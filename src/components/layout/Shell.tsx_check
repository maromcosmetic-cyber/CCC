import { Video, Sparkles, Mic, Subtitles, Wand2, Layers } from "lucide-react";

// Assuming these icons are available in lucide-react. 
// If not, I'll stick to standard ones available from the previous Shell.tsx context.
// Re-verifying icons: Video, Sparkles, Mic, Subtitles (imported), Wand2 (imported), Layers, Image (renamed to ImageIcon)

// I don't need to write a file for this, I'm just verifying imports in Shell.tsx via replace_file_content.
// But replace_file_content for DESIGN_SUB_NAV uses 'Subtitles', 'Wand2'.
// I need to ensure they are imported in Shell.tsx.
